Hello, everyone 

This is the first game I made since I learned the course about Unity since Jan 2019.
It took me 30 days to finish this game, including learning basic coding skill in Unity engine, drawing the part of sprites (Ball, Paddle, Life Indicator and Blocks) and of course, fixing many bugs!!!

It is a simple block-breaking game as the title named, but I try to add some adventure elements in this game.
In this game, you are a Hero try to defeat three bosses which are sea monster, mountain hawk and dark bat.
Try to use the ball as your weapon to destroy the body of the bosses which is made of many blocks. 
Be careful! Parts of the blocks need to be hit twice or more to be destroyed.

I know there is still some bugs existing in this game (e.g. Sometimes the ball keeps floating on the top and can't go down).
However, compared to make a game perfect, I prefer to move on to building my next game in order to learn more video game coding skill. 

Hope you enjoy this game and that would be greart to receive any comments and feedbacks!
